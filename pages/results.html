										<h2>Comprehensive NO<sub>2</sub> Exposure Analysis in Slovakia (2013–2022)</h2>

										<!-- Section 1 -->
										<h3>1. Temporal Trends of NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations</h3>
										<p>
  											The analysis of mean annual NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from 2013 to 2022 in Slovakia reveals a clear pattern of environmental variation:
										</p>
										<ul>
  											<li><strong>Peak Period (2015–2017):</strong> NO<sub>2</sub> levels were highest between 2015 and 2017, peaking in 2017 at approximately 11.3 µg/m³. These elevated values likely reflect intensified urban traffic, industrial emissions, and seasonal heating.</li>
  											<li><strong>Decline and Stabilization (2018–2022):</strong> Concentrations significantly dropped after 2017, reaching a low in 2019 (6.2 µg/m³), partially influenced by stricter environmental regulations and reduced human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. While levels slightly rebounded in 2021–2022, they remained below earlier peaks.</li>
  											<li><strong>Implications:</strong> This pattern suggests effective pollution mitigation strategies and highlights the impact of human behavior on air quality.</li>
										</ul>

										</div>

										<!-- Section 3 -->
										<h3>3. Environmental and Policy Context</h3>
										<ul>
  											<li><strong>Compliance with EU Standards:</strong> As a member of the European Union, Slovakia enforces ambient NO<sub>2</sub> limits under the Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC), promoting better urban air quality through cleaner transportation and stricter emissions controls.</li>
  											<li><strong>Urban Emissions Drivers:</strong> The dominant sources of NO<sub>2</sub> pollution are traffic congestion and industrial processes concentrated in cities, while rural regions show lower values.</li>
  											<li><strong>COVID-19 Impact:</strong> The sharp decline in 2020 coincides with reduced transport and industrial activity during lockdowns, reinforcing the role of anthropogenic emissions.</li>
										</ul>

										<!-- Section 4 -->
										<h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
										<p>To enhance the clarity and policy impact of NO<sub>2</sub> exposure studies in Slovakia, the following steps are recommended:</p>
										<ul>
  											<li>Expand spatial granularity to detect neighborhood-level exposure variations.</li>
  											<li>Introduce season-specific analysis to account for heating-related pollution surges.</li>
  											<li>Encourage public transport development and reduce urban vehicular traffic.</li>
  											<li>Integrate exposure data with health outcomes to inform targeted interventions.</li>
										</ul>

										<hr />

										<h3>Conclusion</h3>
										<p>
  											Slovakia has made significant progress in reducing NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over the past decade. However, the persistence of exposure disparities calls for refined monitoring and targeted policy measures to ensure equitable air quality benefits across all regions.

										<h2>Comprehensive PM<sub>10</sub> Exposure Analysis in Slovakia (2013–2022)</h2>

<!-- Section 1 -->
<h3>1. Temporal Trends of PM<sub>10</sub> Concentrations</h3>
<p>
  The analysis of mean and maximum annual PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations from 2013 to 2022 in Slovakia reveals a clear pattern of particulate variation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Peak Period (2015–2017):</strong> Mean PM<sub>10</sub> hovered around 19–20 µg/m³, while annual maxima climbed from ~23 µg/m³ in 2013 to ~25 µg/m³ by 2017. These elevated values likely reflect intensified winter heating, urban traffic peaks, and episodic dust or biomass-burning events.</li>
  <li><strong>Decline and Stabilization (2018–2020):</strong> Mean levels fell steadily to about 16 µg/m³ by 2020, and maxima dropped back to ~20 µg/m³—partially influenced by stricter emissions regulations and reduced human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
  <li><strong>Partial Rebound (2021–2022):</strong> Mean PM<sub>10</sub> rebounded to ~19.5 µg/m³ in 2021 before easing to ~17 µg/m³ in 2022, while maxima surged again to ~24–25 µg/m³ as societal and economic activities resumed.</li>
  <li><strong>Implications:</strong> This trajectory demonstrates that regulatory measures and reduced human activity can rapidly lower both background and peak PM<sub>10</sub> levels, but episodic spikes still occur—ongoing controls and real-time monitoring remain crucial.</li>
</ul>

										<h2>Comprehensive PM<sub>2.5</sub> Exposure Analysis in Slovakia (2013-2022)</h2>

										<!-- Section 1 -->
										<h3>1. Temporal Trends of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations</h3>
										<p>
  											The analysis of mean annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over a ten-year period (2013–2022) in Slovakia reveals a clear pattern of environmental change:
										</p>
										<ul>
  											<li><strong>Elevated Levels (2015–2017):</strong> The country experienced its highest PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations between 2015 and 2017, with a peak in 2015 (16.71 µg/m³). These elevated levels may be attributed to increased industrial activities, seasonal heating, and limited pollution control measures during that period.</li>
  											<li><strong>Decline and Stabilization (2018–2022):</strong> A downward trend began after 2017, with concentrations dropping to a low of 12.54 µg/m³ in 2020, likely influenced by both stricter air quality regulations and reduced emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a slight rebound occurred in 2021, the values in 2022 remained lower than the peak years, indicating long-term improvement.</li>
  											<li><strong>Trend Implications:</strong> This decline suggests that air quality policies and technological upgrades—such as improved emissions control, modernization of heating systems, and better monitoring—have started to show measurable impact.</li>
										</ul>

										<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
  											<h4>Annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> Trend in Slovakia (2013–2022)</h4>
 			 								<img src="../images/pm2.5trend.png" alt="PM2.5 Trend Chart" style="width: 50%; max-width: 600px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" />
										</div>

										<!-- Section 2 -->
										<h3>2. Population Exposure Distribution</h3>
										<p>
  											The pie chart visualization represents population exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution levels based on zonal classification for the year 2020:
										</p>
										<ul>
  											<li><strong>Homogeneous Exposure:</strong> The entire population was classified under a single pollution risk category, indicating a lack of regional differentiation in exposure levels—either due to actual environmental uniformity or limitations in classification resolution.</li>
  											<li><strong>Possible Causes:</strong> This could result from using broad exposure thresholds, insufficiently disaggregated pollution or population data, or genuine uniform air quality patterns across zones.</li>
  											<li><strong>Implications for Health Risk Assessment:</strong> While such homogeneity may simplify communication, it risks overlooking localized pollution hotspots or vulnerable subpopulations, potentially leading to underestimation of exposure-related health risks.</li>
										</ul>

										<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
  											<h4>Population Exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> Risk Categories (2020)</h4>
  											<img src="../images/Pm2.5pie.png" alt="PM2.5 Exposure Pie Chart" style="width: 60%; max-width: 500px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;" />
										</div>

										<!-- Section 3 -->
										<h3>3. Environmental and Policy Context</h3>
										<ul>
  											<li><strong>EU and National Regulations:</strong> Slovakia, as an EU member state, adheres to EU ambient air quality standards. Over the last decade, efforts under directives like the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC) have driven improvements through stricter industrial emissions standards and air quality plans in major cities.</li>
  											<li><strong>Urbanization and Emissions Sources:</strong> Urban and semi-urban areas are likely major contributors to PM<sub>2.5</sub> through traffic, domestic heating, and industrial sources. Rural areas may experience different patterns due to biomass burning or agricultural practices.</li>
  											<li><strong>Impact of COVID-19:</strong> The significant drop in 2020 aligns with the global slowdown in transportation and industrial activity, emphasizing the influence of anthropogenic sources.</li>
										</ul>

										<!-- Section 4 -->
										<h3>4. Recommendations</h3>
										<p>To enhance the reliability and policy relevance of PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure analysis in Slovakia, the following steps are advised:</p>
										<ul>
  											<li>Refine Zonal Classifications: Use more granular land cover and population density data to improve spatial resolution of exposure categories.</li>
  											<li>Incorporate Additional Metrics: Include seasonal variations, standard deviations, or exceedance days to better capture exposure risk.</li>
  											<li>Cross-Validate with Health Data: Align pollution data with respiratory and cardiovascular health statistics for evidence-based policy.</li>
  											<li>Public Awareness and Action: Promote cleaner household fuels, reduce traffic congestion, and invest in green infrastructure in urban areas.</li>
										</ul>

										<hr />

										<h3>Conclusion</h3>
										<p>
  											The data clearly indicates that PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Slovakia have improved overall, yet uniform exposure classifications mask potential inequalities in health risk. A deeper, more nuanced analysis using fine-scale spatial data and adaptive classification thresholds is essential for targeted interventions and effective air quality management.

								         <h2>Issue 1: Abnormal values in annual average pollutant raster layers</sub></h2>
										      <p><em>Exported raster files showed unreasonable minimum or maximum values (e.g., extremely negative numbers).</em></p>
											  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Original layers contained NoData values or were not properly clipped.
                                              Solution:Export layers as GeoTIFF with Set NoData to -9999 checked.
                                              After export, go to Layer Properties → Information to verify correct min/max values.</p>
										
										 <h2>Issue 2: Raster calculator results returned all zeros or invalid values</sub></h2>
										      <p><em>Calculation produced no meaningful output.</em></p>
											  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Included NoData pixels or mismatched extent/resolution between input layers.Use only clean exported GeoTIFF layers as inputs.In raster calculator, apply conditions like: ("layer@1" > -1000) to exclude NoData values from calculations.</p>

										<h2>Issue 3: Maps misalignment </sub></h2>
										      <p><em>Issues often arise when working with multi-sourced data produced at different scales. There is no universal solution, and each case usually requires individual evaluation.</em></p>
											  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">For our simplified projects, it may be best to avoid addressing this complexity. However, if you want to avoid such a problem, you can try finding country boundaries at a lower scale or downloading raster data for neighboring countries and clipping them using the boundaries.</p>
