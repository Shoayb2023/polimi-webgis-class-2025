											<h2>What is air pollution?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the atmosphere,
											 leading to a decline in air quality and having adverse effects on human health,
											  the ecological environment, and the climate system. The main pollutants include sulfur dioxide, 
											  nitrogen oxides, inhalable particulate matter (such as PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide,
											   and volatile organic compounds. These substances primarily originate from industrial emissions,
											    vehicle exhaust, construction activities, and agricultural operations. 
												Air pollution can trigger respiratory diseases, contribute to cardiovascular problems, 
												and even alter the structure of the atmosphere, thereby causing global warming and acid rain. 
												Clean air is a basic human right; therefore, it is essential to measure and monitor air pollution.
												 This not only helps identify pollution sources in a timely manner but also provides strong data support for policy-making and environmental management.</p>

											<h2>About Slovakia</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Slovakia is a landlocked country in Central Europe, renowned for its natural beauty and cultural heritage, 
										     including the High Tatras mountains, dense forests, and historic castles. The country boasts a rich cultural legacy,
										     blending Slavic traditions with influences from neighboring nations. Its capital, Bratislava, located along the Danube River, serves as the political, 
										     cultural, and economic center of the country. Since joining the European Union in 2004, Slovakia has experienced steady economic growth and modernization.<br />
									         However, the country continues to face significant challenges related to air pollution. Major air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen oxides frequently exceed the health limits set by the European Union in many regions,
									        especially during the winter months when a large number of households rely on solid fuel for heating. Industrial emissions, transportation, and outdated heating systems are the primary sources of pollution. 
									        Although air quality has improved since the 1990s, air pollution still leads to thousands of premature deaths in Slovakia every year.

									       <h2>What we are going to do in the lab?</h2>
								    </header>
									     <p>This project focuses on analyzing historical time-series air quality data in Slovakia in relation to various land cover types,
											 aiming to detect long-term environmental trends and patterns.
											  By correlating pollutant concentrations with land use categories, we seek to understand how different landscapes influence or are affected by air pollution over time. 
											  Additionally, we will assess population exposure to key air pollutants, placing special emphasis on regions where pollutant levels exceed health-based guidelines, 
											  thereby identifying areas of potential public health concern. To ensure the results are accessible and informative,
											   we will develop an interactive WebGIS platform and a dedicated project webpage. These tools will be used to visualize spatial and temporal patterns,
											    communicate key findings effectively, and support data-driven decision-making for environmental planning and policy development.
